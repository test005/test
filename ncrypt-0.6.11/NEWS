0.6.9
16Mar2004 - Code is pretty ugly, hard to troubleshoot the post arg processing
            so simplified things. Removed all of Inertia's code and redid
            the entire getopt processing. There was a problem that if someone
            forgot to specify the -e, ncrypt would interpret that as a wipe
            only operation and securely wipe the input file. This is fixed.
            General code cleanup on ncrypt.c, removed cmdline.c and cmdline.h
            entirely. Will probably go through and clean up remaining code.

0.6.8
15Sep2003 - Naming conflict with XPG4.2 within unistd.h, renamed a routine.

0.6.7
09Sep2003 - Ugh. Dependency problems. Redid configure.in from scratch, and
            redid all of the automake support files. Stuff seems to build 
            and install ok now without too many errors. Edited cmdline.h
            to eliminate non-printing of package and version info. Tweaked
            the man page. Minor tweaks to rand_gen.c, cmdline.c, and
            get_encryption_password.c to eliminate compilation errors.

0.6.6
16Aug2003 - Updated configure.ac so that it will work with autoconf 2.53.
            Added 'debian' directory to version control.

0.6.5
03Aug2003 - Fixed minor typo in help info. Adjusted some logic in the main
            program, as illogical parameter choices caused illogical things
            to happen. Set default wipe mode to military if not specified.

0.6.4
14Jul2003 - NTFS and djgpp don't seem to get along when it comes to handling
            the file slack wiping and the verify in military wiping, so
            currently the WIN32 version does not support it. Completed the
            WIN32 version, fixed minor bug with --aes option in cmdline.c.

09May2003 - Added routines for doing DoD 5220.22-M style of wiping, giving the
            choice of two wiping methods. The DoD method uses 3 passes, the
            third pass being verified as it is being to disk. Added a -a
            (--aes) option which simply points to Rijndael. Updated all of
            the relevant files (README, man page, etc). Fixed a bug in the
            install routine which tried to install the header files in this
            distro.

03May2003 - Added better error handling to wipe_file.c, and added routine to
            perform wiping on file slack of file being wiped.

01May2003 - fopen truncates the file before returning, so updated wipe_file
            to use open instead. Wiping is much slower now, so added UI
            indications in --verbose mode that something is actually
            happening. Updated man page to make it more accurate.

0.6.3
26Apr2003 - Oops, odd logic bug caused ncrypt to never encrypt or decrypt
            a file, only show the help screen, ugh. Adjusted read_pass to
            use tcsetattr and tcgetattr, making the code more portable.
            Minor tweaks in ncrypt.c and rand_gen.c so it will compile
            under djgpp. Created a makefile for djgpp. Added local getopt
            routines if target does not have getopt or getopt_long (Mac 
            OS X, djgpp).

0.6.2
23Apr2003 - Two bugs in shuffling of order of the constant overwrites in
            wipe_file.c, updated the README to reflect the current version.

0.6.1
22Apr2003 - Autoconf and automake. Use of long options as well. A lot of
            code cleanup. Added, then removed I/O using stdin/stdout instead
            of files (too many security issues as of yet).

21Apr2003 - Switched the random number seeding algorithm used during
            file deletion to one based on processor timing events, and
            the PRNG from rand() to ISAAC. Also shuffled the order
            of the constant overwrites, as recommended by Peter
            Gutmann.

0.5.5
14Feb2003 - Fixed a bug that allowed -w to work during encryption, which
            completely erased the input file and there was no output file
            at all (oops). Applied patch so read_pass compiles and runs on
            FreeBSD, and adjusted how memory is locked to prevent paging
            (not all systems support mlockall).

0.5.4
30Jan2003 - Updated the wipe_file.c program to use the wiping techniques
            discussed in "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State
            Memory" by Peter Gutmann. The original paper can be found at
            http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html. This
            changes the wiping algo for a total of 35 overwrites. Updated
            the README as well.
31Dec2002 - Added mem.c routine so that if optimized, we don't rely on memset
            but use our own. Updated the Makefile. Added a TODO file. Added
            code to check for running as root, and if so try to mlockall to
            prevent paging memory to disk. Updated the README.

0.5.3       ** non-release **

0.5.2
19Dec2002 - Fixed minor bug in wipe_file routine. Minor code cleanup and updates
            to the README and man page.
17Dec2002 - Moved some random number stuff to rand_gen.c. Moved the wipe_file
            routine to wipefile.c. Increased the overwrites to a total of
            27 times (14 passes with zeroes, 13 passes with random material). 
            Added -V switch to print version. Updated the man page.
18Sep2002 - Added string.h to readpass.c to eliminate an error. Added a
            HISTORY file.

0.5.1
09Sep2002 - Added README and built man page.
05Sep2002 - Code cleanup, tweaks, and minor bugfixes to Twofish code. Added
            WIPEONLY mode to do the wiping on a single file.
04Sep2002 - Added Twofish, had to remove the key block size.

0.4.1
03Sep2002 - Adjusted key block size to a variable in ncrypt.h. Added install
            routine to Makefile.
31Aug2002 - Minor code cleanup, added code to wipe hash from memory after
            it is no longer needed.

0.4
30Aug2002 - Major code cleanup (it now compiles without warnings), and uses
            full ascii keyspace from the hash instead of a limited keyspace.
            Also added file wiping ability on encryption.

0.3
29Aug2002 - Initial revision of ncrypt, first version that doesn't segfault ;-)
