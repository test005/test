TODO List
---------

This is a simple list of things to add to future versions:

 - Either allow wildcards while wiping only, or split out the wiping routines
into a separate file that can handle wildcards.

 - If wiping with widlcards, allow recursion into subdirectories.

 - Rename the file right after the wiping process but right before removing it
from the drive, to prevent sensitive information from being revealed in the 
filename itself. Same for subdirectories.

 - Implement "triple Ncrypt". The way 3DES works is data is encrypted with DES
three times -- once with a key, once with a second key, and a third time
(usually with the first key again). Undecided how to implement the second key,
I may go radical and simply ask for a second passphrase, will read up on it
first though. It should work using all the algorithms in Ncrypt though.

 - Figure out how to get djgpp to do file slack wiping and to not crap all
over the verify parts of military wiping for the WIN32 version.
