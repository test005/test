Your basic install cruft...

The simplest way to compile this package is:

1. ./configure

2. make

3. make install <-- Requires root if you're installing to /usr/local (the
                    default), use ./configure --prefix=DIR to change the 
                    install dir.

If you require additional options, such as alternate compilers, etc.,
try ./configure --help.

If there are problems with ./configure (such as requiring different versions 
of automake, etc), run the ./Build.sh script, then re-run ./configure.
